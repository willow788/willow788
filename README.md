# Hi 👋 I'm Srija  
Chaos wizard, AI/ML nerd, and the reason “productive procrastination” exists.

### 🚀 What I’m Doing  
I’m an ECE undergrad with a brain wired for machine learning and the occasional existential crisis. I write code so things work, not just to look cool on LinkedIn.

### 💡 Stuff I Actually Give a Damn About  
- Machine Learning & AI — because robots should do the boring parts  
- Data Science — data doesn’t lie (people do)  
- Python, SQL & nerding out over elegant solutions  
- Open-source projects that don’t suck  

### 🛠 Tech Stack (My Toys)  
- 🐍 Python (of course)  
- 🧠 ML/AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn  
- 📊 Data tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 💻 Web stuff: HTML/CSS/JS when forced  
- 🧩 SQL & databases because data lives somewhere

### 📈 Fun Stats  
- 💻 Repositories: constantly growing  
- ☕ Coffee consumed per project: catastrophic  
- 🧠 Bugs squashed: more than I expected

### 💬 Let’s Connect  
- GitHub: https://github.com/willow788

- Email: 

Happy to collab on anything that isn’t boring.  
If it’s boring, bribe me with caffeine.
